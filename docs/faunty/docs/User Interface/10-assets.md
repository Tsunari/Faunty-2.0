# Assets

Icons:
- Use the `assets/` folder and keep icon filenames consistent (kebab-case). Example: `assets/icons/ic_kantin.svg`.

Illustrations:
- Store large illustrations in `assets/illustrations/` or use CDN links if large. Keep file sizes optimized for web.

Fonts:
- See `pubspec.yaml` for registered fonts. Include license information when adding new fonts.

Exporting from Figma:
- Provide SVG for icons and 2x/3x PNG for raster assets. Include Figma frame name and version in the doc entry.
