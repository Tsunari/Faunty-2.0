# Contributing

Guidelines for contributors:

- Follow `flutter_lints` and run `flutter analyze` before opening PRs.
- Use Riverpod patterns found in `lib/state_management/`.
- Add i18n keys for any new user-facing strings and run the Slang extract/generate steps.
- Keep components small and reusable; prefer adding examples where helpful.

Small checklist for PRs:

1. Run `flutter pub get` and `flutter analyze`.
2. Add or update tests for new features.
3. Update `README.md` or relevant docs under `docs/faunty/docs/`.

Thank you for contributing â€” small, focused PRs are easiest to review.
