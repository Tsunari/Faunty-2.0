# Overview

Faunty is a modern Flutter app for team and organization management. It focuses on real-time collaboration, simple UX, and modular code structure.

Key points:

- Code lives primarily under `lib/`.
- Firebase is used for Auth and Firestore; initialization is in `lib/main.dart` and `firebase_options.dart`.
- Riverpod is used for state management and real-time streams.

This documentation follows the project's conventions and mirrors the file/folder layout to make it easy for contributors to find relevant code.
